Description: You can use the functions provided by the package to make various statistical tables, 
             such as baseline data tables. Creates 'Table 1', i.e., a description of the baseline patient
             characteristics, which is essential in every medical research.
             Supports both continuous and categorical variables, as well as
             p-values and standardized mean differences.
             This method was described by Mary L McHugh (2013) <doi:10.11613/bm.2013.018>.
